I am a **Web** and **Mobile developer**, very addicted to computers, mobile phones, robots and technology-science in general. **Android** and **MacOS** “funboy”, using **Laravel** and **Vue.js** like sick! Music, Cinema, Football and other bla-bla-bla borring stuff like that, also “work” on me!

I don’t know where I live but I certenly know where I want to live. I am trying hard to work on something but I the end this something works on me! I enjoy drinking absinthe and eating ambrosia while I observe and dicover mathematical paterns in the universe. I know 3.128 different languages but I have the ability to talk with only the 1.008 of them. I have stoped the “mind reading” (in the last 25 earthly years) because here (in earth) NO ONE is thinking. I sleep for 3 seconds and 45 microseconds in every full rotation of the earth arround the sun. I have lived 256 lives untill now and this is my 258th life (except here, I currently live in parallel universe at the same time). I don’t have shadow! My real name can only be said telepathically. And finally, If my physical body, contacts with compounds of trioxide hydro-diethylamine, I annihilate myself and reveal the first four (4) levels (of 7) of my soul.
